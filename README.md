# Call-Center- Trends
This is a dashboard on the PWC forsage Intership Call Center Dataset.
here i will want to find insights to help the Management take appropriate actions.
these are some few of the insights i got:


**Customer Satisfaction:** On average, customer satisfaction was rated at 3.40 on a scale of 1-5.

**Average Answer Speed:** The average answer speed was 1 minute and 7 seconds.

**Call Answer Rate:** 81% of calls received were answered.

**Call Resolution Rate:** 73% of calls received were resolved.

**Top Issue:** The most common issue reported by customers was related to streaming.

**Call Trends:** Over time, the number of calls received has been steadily declining.

**Agent Performance:** Jim performed exceptionally well, receiving the most calls, having the most resolved issues, and ranking 4th in terms of fastest answer time. On the other hand, Joe's performance lags behind, with the lowest average satisfaction score, the longest response time, and the second-lowest number of resolved issues.

## Recommendations

1. **Improve Answer Speed**: To boost customer satisfaction, aim to reduce the average answer speed to less than a minute.

2. **Address Streaming Issues**: Investigate and resolve issues related to streaming and technical support, as these seem to be the most prevalent problems among customers.

3. **Performance Improvement for Joe**: Implement measures to motivate and enhance Joe's performance, as this could contribute to an overall improvement in customer satisfaction.

   
**Other recommendations includes:**

5. Collecting direct customer feedback after each call.

6. Consider performance-based incentives for agents.

7. Invest in ongoing agent training and development.

8. Conducting regular performance reviews with agents.
   
9. Explore automation for routine tasks to improve efficiency.
