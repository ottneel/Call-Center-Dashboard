# Call-Center-Dashboard
This is a dashboard on the PWC forsage Intership Call Center Dataset.
here i will want to find insights to help the Management take appropriate actions.
these are few of the insights i got:
1. On a scale of 1-5, On Average, CUstomer Satisfaction was 3.40
2. Average Answer Speed was 1min 7secs
3. 81% of calls received were Answered
4. 73% of calls rceived were Resolved
5. The most issue was On Streaming
6. Overtime, the Amount of calls received has steadily been on a decline.
7. I rate Jim as the best Agent as he recieved the most calls,, has the most resolved issues and the 4th fastest answer time.
8. Joe isnt really doing that great as he has the lowest avg_satisfaction_score, the longest to answer calls and second to the least in amount of resolved calls

## Recommendations
1. the satisfiation score of 3.40 can still be improved by reducing the answer speed to less than a minute.
2. Issues on streaming and technical suppot should be looked into
3. Measures should be put in place to encourage Joe to perform better as this can improve the customer satisfication score
